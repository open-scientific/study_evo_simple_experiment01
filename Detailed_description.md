# Experiment Design for Creating and Studying Exotic Vacuum Objects

This experiment is designed to generate and study exotic vacuum objects (EVOs), also known as charge clusters, plasmoids, or strange radiation, using a low-cost and simple setup that avoids transistor-based switching. The goal is to create these phenomena through high-voltage spark discharges in an air-water environment and direct their emissions toward a target sample, such as a sheet of material or a gas enclosure, for observation and analysis. The design prioritizes simplicity and replicability, drawing inspiration from experimental methods discussed in the "Proceedings of the 28th Russian Conference on Cold Nuclear Transmutation and Ball Lightning."

# Description of the Experiment

The experiment uses a Van de Graaff generator to produce high-voltage electrostatic discharges that spark from its sphere to a grounded electrode submerged in water. This setup creates conditions at the air-water interface where EVOs may form, potentially mimicking phenomena like ball lightning or low-energy nuclear reaction (LENR) byproducts. The emissions are directed toward a target sample placed near the discharge path, allowing for detection of any resulting effects, such as luminescence, physical marks, or ionization.

# Key Features:

- **Generation Method:** High-voltage sparks from a Van de Graaff generator to a water surface.
- **Environment:** Air-water interface, leveraging water’s interaction with electric discharges.
- **Target Sample:** A phosphor-coated screen (for visible detection) or photographic paper (for post-experiment analysis).
- **Safety Note:** High voltages are involved, so proper insulation and distancing are required. Claims of nuclear effects are controversial, but weak emissions are assumed for simplicity, with no complex shielding.

# Procedure:

- 1. Set up the Van de Graaff generator and verify it operates correctly.
- 2. Fill a beaker with distilled water and submerge a grounded metal electrode.
- 3. Position the target sample (e.g., phosphor screen) near the discharge path.
- 4. Operate the Van de Graaff generator until sparks jump from the sphere to the water surface.
- 5. Observe the target for immediate effects (e.g., glows on a phosphor screen) or analyze it later (e.g., develop photographic paper for tracks).

# Detailed Description of Power Supply and Signal Generator

# Power Supply:

- **Type:** Van de Graaff generator (homemade or purchased).
- **Specifications:** Capable of producing at least 100 kV of electrostatic potential. Homemade versions can be constructed using a PVC pipe, rubber belt, and metal dome, powered by a hand crank or small motor (e.g., from a toy or drill).
- **Operation:** The generator charges its sphere via a moving belt that transfers static charge. No external battery or electronic power source is required beyond mechanical energy, avoiding transistor-based components entirely.
- **Cost:** Affordable, as DIY versions use common materials (estimated cost: $20–$50), and small commercial models are inexpensive.

# Signal Generator:

- **Type:** Inherent pulsing from the Van de Graaff discharge mechanism.
- **Details:** No separate signal generator is needed. The discharges occur naturally when the sphere’s potential exceeds the breakdown voltage of the air gap to the water (typically several kV/cm, adjustable by distance). This creates a pulsed output, with frequency depending on the generator’s charge rate and gap size (e.g., 1–10 Hz).
- **Advantage:** Avoids transistor switching, as the pulsing is a physical property of the electrostatic discharge, making it robust against emission-induced failures.
