# Low-Cost Experiment to Create and Study Exotic Vacuum Objects

# Objective
Generate exotic vacuum objects (EVOs) using a simple, replicable setup and direct their emissions toward a target sample.

# Components

- Van de Graaff Generator: 100 kV minimum, homemade or purchased.
- Water Container: 500 ml beaker with distilled water.
- Grounded Electrode: Metal rod submerged in water, grounded.
- Target Sample: Phosphor-coated screen (zinc sulfide on cardboard) or photographic paper.

# Setup

- 1. Position Van de Graaff sphere above a beaker of water.
- 2. Submerge grounded electrode in water.
- 3. Place target sample 5â€“10 cm from sphere or above water surface.
- 4. Adjust sphere-to-water distance for periodic sparks.

# Procedure

- 1. Start Van de Graaff generator.
- 2. Observe sparks from sphere to water.
- 3. Check target for glows (phosphor) or develop paper for tracks post-experiment.

# Power Supply

Van de Graaff Generator: Electrostatic, no transistors, pulsed discharges via natural breakdown.
